# Hi! I'm Filip ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a hobbyist programmer with a strong background in web development. Over the years, Iâ€™ve enjoyed building projects that live in the browser, but lately Iâ€™ve been shifting my focus towards app development with Swift.

Iâ€™m passionate about learning, experimenting, and creating things that people actually use. This profile is a mix of some of my past projects and my current journey into the Swift ecosystem. ðŸš€
